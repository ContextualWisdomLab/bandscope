# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Name tonight's first playable range on the ready rehearsal map and tell the player to check that span on their instrument before the section.
- Display the analyzed song tempo (BPM) as a badge in the rehearsal workspace.
- 각 합주 역할(Role)별 개인 연습 진행도를 0~100% 범위로 기록 및 시각화할 수 있는 연습 진척도(`practiceProgress`) 트래커 기능 추가. UI 컨트롤(슬라이더 및 +/- 버튼)과 한/영 다국어 지원 포함.

### Changed

- Raised the configured desktop and shared-types Vitest coverage thresholds to 100% for lines, functions, branches, and statements, with a regression guard against reintroducing a lower owned JavaScript coverage floor.
- Pinned npm `10.9.9` as the approved lockfile generator, activated it through Node-bundled Corepack before dependency consumption, and fail closed unless its bundled `tar` is at least `7.5.19`; primary CI still consumes the committed lock only through frozen `npm ci` validation, rejects mutable npm resolution in the lock gate, requires integrity evidence for public-registry lock entries, and preserves generator-sensitive root `@esbuild/*` peer metadata.

### Fixed

- Upgraded the local score PDF parser to `pdfjs-dist` 6.2.108, pinned Undici 7.29.0 across the workspace, and constrained PDF loading to copied in-memory bytes with a same-origin bundled worker and npm-generated lock provenance.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- Published release assets through a tag-driven draft release flow so immutable GitHub Releases include desktop installers, checksums, SBOM, and supplemental inventory before publication.
- Added a supply-chain regression guard that rejects post-publication release asset uploads.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-29
